**Why this adapter differs from the others?**

1. Konica AR has a very short flange focal distance for a vintage SLR mount
2. The aperture measuring pin protrude quite far from the back of the lens (~11mm)

So, the adapter had to be modified so the fitler carrier clears the lens. The filter carrier still allows the use of up to 3mm thick 
glass filters but doesn't have a retaining ring on the holding plate. It's significantly flatter so not cross-compatible.

** PARTS LIST**

- 6x M2.5 heat inserts (less than 3.5mm long)
- 4x M2.5x14mm screw (flat top)
- 2x M2.5x5mm screw (flat top)
- glue (CA glue worked well on PETG/PLA)

** BUILD INSTRUCTIONS **

Adapter:
1. Download and print the model
2. melt heat-inserts into top piece holes (4x)
3. add glue to mounting surface
4. line up middle piece, place down
5. add glue to next mounting surface
6. line up bottom piece, place down
7. stick M2.5x14mm through holes, screw everything together
8. clean up squeeze-out if desired

Filter carrier:
1. Download
2. Select carrier meant for your glass filter. If you don't have one just choose a big carrier (36mm+ for full-frame)
3. Print
4. melt M2.5 heat-inserts into main carrier plate
5. screw M2.5 screw into heat-inserts to clean out any molten plastic


Additional Tipps:
- make sure your print has good layer adhesion!
- print the top and bottom plates extra sturdy. They're particularly load bearing
- test-fit parts before applying glue
- let the glue cure properly! Can take more than a day with CA glue
- be careful with heavy lenses
